# Django Financial Alerts System

This project leverages the Django [REST] framework, including its built-in user
authentication system, to serve as a foundation for developing a proof of concept for a
comprehensive financial alerts system. Developers are encouraged to build upon
this base to incorporate advanced financial alert features.

## Features

- Utilization of Django's built-in user authentication for secure login and registration
- A framework ready to be extended with financial alert functionalities.
- **Designed to integrate seamlessly with financial data and alerting logic.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django
- Django REST Framework (for API development)
- Other Django-compatible packages as needed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Apply migrations using `python manage.py migrate`.
5. Run the development server using `python manage.py runserver`.

## Notes

- By leveraging Django's built-in features, we significantly reduce the initial setup
time, allowing us to concentrate on implementing the financial alerts functionalities.
- Developers are encouraged to utilize Django's ORM and REST Framework for efficient
data handling and API development.
- `transactions.json` is provided as a sample data set for the financial alerts system,
demonstrating how financial data can be structured and utilized within the project.
